## 5. Algorithms & Machine Learning

Placeholder
<!-- I tested several different regression models from [SciKit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)'s regression models. After finding a few that were close in performance, tuning brought about some bigger disparities that made Gradient Boost the winner for the filtering function of the algorithm and Ada Boost the winner of the player picking part of the algorithm.

>***NOTE:** I chose RMSE to control for dealing with outliers in the data. It's hard to consistently find players that score more than 30, 40 points, and some weeks they don't even occur. So RMSE would, because we are taking the root of those errors, control for those random high performers a little better.* -->

## 6. Pseudo-Coldstart Threshold

Placeholder
<!-- **Coldstart Threshold**: Recommender systems have a unique issue: *what does the algorithm recommend to new users when it has very little or no prior data?* 

Due to trades, player releases, the Draft, and some other stuff, there can be a lot of changes from season to season. So while we aren't using a recommender system, there's still the issue of picking players at the beginning of the season with the data that we *do* have.

I decided there were 2 options:

- Use last year's season data as a whole to make a decision for week 1 of this season.
- Wait for week 1's data in order to begin during week 2.

Because of how draft's work and the copious amounts of trades during the off-season, I decided to wait til week 1 was over and begin the process then. -->
