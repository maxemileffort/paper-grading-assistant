      "Unexpected error: (<class 'UnicodeDecodeError'>, UnicodeDecodeError('utf-8', b's top doctors that too much time spent on the computer can cause damage to your health. Exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm. They can submerge themselves into obesity. This often causes depression as it begins to sink in. Addition itself is a serious health issue. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they add a computer wing to rehab centers sometime in the near future. These problems are slowly spreading and we must come together to abolish them! Family time is an treasured value, to the @CAPS2 people, but lately, computers are ruining this tradition. With so @CAPS1 people absorbed with online drama, friends, and even video games, family interaction is declining. People slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace. They @MONTH1 only emerge from their rooms to use the bathroom and eat, scarcely resting. This can cause great tension or sorrow in @CAPS1 families. Who can erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely clever. Your children could be talking to someone they believe is another teenager looking for a friend to console in when, really, they are a forty-year-old serial killer waiting to find the right time to attack. Studies show that one fourth of online users have had an encounter with a dangerous person.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n12\\t1\\tDear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I feel that computers do take away from peoples life and aren\\x92t as important than the other factors of life. First of all you know that the world is becoming obease because of lack of exercise. Also people don\\'t realize that @CAPS3 warming is becomeing a big problum. Finally familys arn\\'t as close as they used to be. these are all the reasons why computers arn\\'t important to human socioty. First of the world is becomeing obease and cumputers play a huge part in this. Computers don\\'t make people exercise they basicly just sit down on there couch and use the computer this won\\'t help amarica get back into shape. Also computers become a habbit if a person uses a computer everyday of there life it will become an addiction then they won\\'t be able to stop. Finally when people use the computer they don\\'t realize the lack exersise there getting. This is the first reason why computeres are a bad thing. Next @CAPS3 warming is mealting the polar ice caps. Computers play a part in @CAPS3 warming because they use electricty and thjen the electrisity melts the polar ice caps. If this keeps happining then they will all melt and we will not have a shorline and half of the world will be fluded. Finally computers play a huge part in @CAPS3 warming because of the fact that they are so popular. This is another reason why computers are bad. Finally the last reason why computers are bad is because they take away from your family life. For instance there are more and more familys splitting up now and sientest sat that @PERCENT1 of the time it\\'s because of technolagy. When on peroson is on the computer the other people feel that they love the computer more than they love themselfs. Then they split up for good. This is the last reason why I feel computers are bad. In conclution you can see that computeres are a bad thing. First of all you can see that amarica is becomeing obease because of the computers. Also computers are causeing @CAPS3 warming and are eventually goung to flood the earth. And last but not least computers take away from peoples family life and cause them to split up and become unhappy. These are all the reasons why computers are bad.\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n13\\t1\\tDear local newspaper I raed ur argument on the computers and I think they are a positive effect on people. The first reson I think they are a good effect is because you can do so much with them like if you live in mane and ur cuzin lives in califan you and him could have a wed chat. The second thing you could do is look up news any were in the world you could be stuck on a plane and it would be vary boring when you can take but ur computer and go on ur computer at work and start doing work. When you said it takes away from exirsis well some people use the computer for that too to chart how fast they run or how meny miles they want and sometimes what they eat. The thrid reson is some peolpe jobs are on the computers or making computers for exmple when you made this artical you didnt use a type writer you used a computer and printed it out if we didnt have computers it would make ur @CAPS1 a lot harder. Thank you for reading and whe you are thinking adout it agen pleas consiter my thrie resons.\\t4\\t3\\t\\t7\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n14\\t1\\tMy three detaileds for this news paper article is one state you opinion about the effects of computers. Seconde give detailed resons that will persuade of the local newspaper to agree with yor postition. This are my three ideas to the news paper article. To bigin my opinion about the computer effects are wast time. Many people wast time computers like fat people insted by insted by in the computer go and run or exercising. Insted be computer go out ur girlfriend or family or family or friends to have fun. So be incomputer to long is bad many kids wach bad stuff like for adults. Is good to be in computer but not to long. To start you shod agree with me becasue my detailed and my reason. My resons are many airs the bas stuff like porn. Many kids wach that it ruins ther mainly and the futur. They get addicted to that watching. So people that use computer for good stuff its old for mids for good ganes of good. This are my detailed and resons for yor with me. To bigin and going to organize my ideas and well and present them clearly. It good to be at the computer but not the long insted go out plat and exersus. abd yor can enjoy life insted be in computer. The bad things many kids wach bad stuff and cmputer has relly bad staff. The computer is use for evrye thing this days. This how organize my ideas. In conclusion this are my ideas for the news papaer. Ols I state my opinion on computer effects. I give detailed and resons that will persuade local news paper and to agree with me. Think I organize my ideas as much present them clearly. This are my ideas so could new papaer to se computers effects. \\t3\\t3\\t\\t6\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n15\\t1\\t\"Dear, In this world today we should have everyone useing computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Today computers are like the worlds biggest book of knowledge. everything you need to know is in a computer. You can look up faraway places, and zap theres everything you need to know write in front of you. Computers are fast and easy, everyone can use them. Today kids are so addicted to computers everyday they are on them. There are so many websites that kids and teens go on, like @CAPS1, and facebook ect. on these websites kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and putting up pictures. Thers is also webchat websites that allow you to use a webcame and talk to people anywhere in the world. Computers are a great way to get in touch with people. Everyone should have a computer in there home today.\"\\t3\\t3\\t\\t6\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n16\\t1\\t\"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen. It was easy to find out how life was in @LOCATION2, thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl explaining it. Going to the library wouldn\\'t have filled one with this priceless information and human interection. Computers are a nessessity of life if soceity wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. Firstly, computers help teach hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is usod to excel in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use.
