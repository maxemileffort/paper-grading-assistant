Entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPassions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, the autobiography documents Sarkozy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rise to power, while hurling barbs at some of his former allies, including his prime minister Francois Fillon.  During his time in office from 2007-2012, Sarkozy earned the nickname \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresident Bling-Bling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for his brash style and close association with tycoons and celebrities. While at the Elysee, he met and married former model Carla Bruni.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPassions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is released as France\\xe2\\x80\\x99s center-right fights for survival two years after President Emmanuel Macron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election win dynamited the political landscape.  Sarkozy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s old party, Les Republicains, is locked in infighting and struggling to find direction, squeezed by Macron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s centrist party and the far right.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe book is a political one, it does not announce my return,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sarkozy told magazine Le Point. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI neither want nor can get involved in a partisan debate. That would sew confusion and division. There is no need for that. It would be misplaced.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Nonetheless, each new appearance by the last unifying figure of the French right is closely followed - fearfully by those wary of the return of a big-name rival, and hopefully by those who long for Sarkozy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political reincarnation.  Sarkozy has retired twice from politics: the first time after he lost his re-election bid in 2012. He returned to lead his party in 2014 only to quit again after he failed to win his party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ticket to run for president in 2017.  Les Republicains are again without a leader after Laurent Wauquiez stepped down following the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismal showing in May\\xe2\\x80\\x99s European election.  Even if Sarkozy were to return to frontline politics, he would struggle to put to one side multiple investigations, including into the financing of his re-election bid.   This month he learnt he must stand trial on charges of corruption and influence peddling in relation to allegations that he offered a judge a promotion in return for information on a parallel investigation.  Sarkozy has denied any wrongdoing.

Air Force Brigade General Miguel Sisco Mora was arrested Friday afternoon in a parking lot in Guatire, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the capital Caracas, his daughter Stephanie Sisco said. Navy Corvette Captain Rafael Costa was detained on Friday in nearby Guarenas, according to his wife Waleska Perez.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe demand that the government provide us with information about his whereabouts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stephanie Sisco wrote on Twitter on Saturday.   The arrests come nearly two months after a failed uprising against Maduro called by opposition leader Juan Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly who in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency and has called on the armed forces to join his cause.  They also come on the heels of a visit to Venezuela by U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, who on Friday called on Maduro to release prisoners arrested for peacefully protesting. Maduro, whose 2018 re-election has been widely denounced as illegitimate, said he would take the U.N.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerns seriously.  Human rights group Penal Forum had previously said that two retired Air Force colonels had been arrested in Caracas on Friday afternoon while two high ranking officials from Venezuela\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CICPC forensic police unit were arrested in Guatire, according to human rights lawyer Tamara Suju.  Neither Venezuela\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Information Ministry nor the Chief Prosecutor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office responded to requests for comment on the six detentions on Sunday.  According to Penal Forum, some 700 people are detained for political reasons in Venezuela, including about 100 members of the military.   Maduro\\xe2\\x80\\x99s government has denied it holds political prisoners, and frequently accuses the opposition of fomenting violence. Maduro refers to Guaido as a puppet of the United States seeking to oust him in a coup.
