      " of our diets. In my heart attack parable, if \n",
      " the doctor had told you that the only way \n",

      " cost on you. Other recent crises offer some examples \n",
      " of cases where key decision-makers did ignore warning signs, \n",
      " because taking those signs seriously would have imposed significant \n",
      " costs on them. For example, in the housing bubble \n",
      " of the mid-2000s, warnings were ignored because the financial \n",
      " industry had staked considerable investments and product lines on \n",
      " the myth that housing values would go up forever. \n",
      " To admit that housing was overvalued and that securitized \n",
      " mortgages were riskier than advertised would have cost investment \n",
      " banks dearly. But eventually, reality caught up with them, \n",
      " and the resulting damage was far worse than it \n",
      " would have been if we had paid attention to \n",
      " the early warning signs. Similarly, many carbon-intensive industries and \n",
      " fossil fuel producers pushed back on findings of climate \n",
      " change because taking those findings seriously would force significant \n",
      " changes in their industries. As a result, these industries \n",
      " funded doubt and uncertainty. The problem has since gotten \n",
      " much worse, and it has become harder to take \n",
      " effective action. The early scientists may have been alarmist. But we'd be in much better shape if we had listened to them. I would be more comforted if I could be certain that Voeten is right and Foa and Mounk are wrong. Maybe there is indeed nothing to worry about. But given the risks, as well as the recent string of election results, I'd rather err on the side of caution. Like the threat of a heart attack, the threat of autocracy or military rule replacing liberal democracy is pretty serious, and very difficult to recover from. I don't want to take a chance.

      " us mere mortals, though, it hardly ever shows up \n",
      " when we need it. Since the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi \n",
      " first described the zone (which he called ‘flow’) in \n",
      " 1975, neuroscientists have been trying to figure out what \n",

      " be in, each of which works for a particular \n",

      " is that it feels great: Csíkszentmihályi describes it as \n",
      " the ‘optimal experience’ in which we can achieve true \n",
      " happiness.  One explanation for why it happens—and why \n",
      " it feels so good—is that it represents a perfect \n",
      " match between activity in brain networks involved in attention \n",
      " and the reward circuitry, which process pleasure. When different \n",
      " networks synchronize their activity—like two pendulums swinging in time—it \n",

      " when you’re in it.  Even Csíkszentmihályi admits, however, \n",
      " that it’s not easy to achieve. “Flow is difficult \n",

      " but Marc Wittmann, a psychologist at the Institute for \n",
      " Frontier Areas in Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg, \n",
      " Germany, and author of  Felt Time, has a \n",
      " couple of suggestions on how it could be done. \n",
      " Wittmann believes that our brains count time by tuning \n",
      " into the rhythms of the body—the regular ticks of \n",
      " our heartbeat, breathing and so on. He calls this \n",
      " ‘body time’ and points to a region of the \n",
      " brain called the insula, which keeps track of our \n",
      " physical and emotional state, as key to this process. \n",
      "  “My idea is that you are attending to \n",
      " yourself, to your bodily self, your mental self and \n",
      " that is how you attend to time,” Wittman says. \n",
      "  In theory, then, if you can change the \n",
      " information that the insula receives, you might be able \n",
      " to control how you perceive time. One thing Wittman \n",
      " suggests is to speed up your bodily signals by \n",
      " exercising. When you stop, the body’s signals will gradually \n",
      " slow down to baseline, slowing your perception of time \n",
      " as it does so.  “Say I go jogging \n",
      " for an hour and then I’m calm down but \n",
      " still feel very active,\"\" Wittman says. \"\"I feel that \n",
      " everything is happening much slower because my body is \n",
      " much more activated and I feel myself much more \n",
      " intensely.\"\" Another option is to direct your attention to \n",
      " the here and now, purposefully focusing on the fine \n",
      " details of your surroundings, thoughts or your mental state. \n",
      " A 10-minute mindfulness meditation will help haul your focus \n",
      " back to the here and now and, by slowing \n",
      " your breathing rate, will also slow down your body \n",
      " signals. Both should make time slow to a much \n",
      " more manageable speed. Wittman’s experiments suggest that expert meditators \n",
      " are able to stretch their perception of a moment \n",
      " by 25 percent, which makes all that sitting around \n",
      " seem well worth the investment of time, no matter \n",
      " how little you have to play with.  The \n",
      " 'Zoned Out' ZoneGiven all the effort we spend trying \n",
      " to get into the zone it might seem strange \n",
      " to actively try to stay out of it. But \n",
      " there are some mental skills that work better when \n",
      " you’re just a little bit away with the fairies. \n",
      " Creativity is one of them. Research by Evangelia Chrysikou \n",
      " at the University of Kansas has found that using \n",
      " brain stimulation to temporarily reduce activity in part of \n",
      " the prefrontal cortex (the region of the brain behind \n",
      " the forehead), increased the number of creative uses for \n",
      " everyday objects that people were able to come up \n",
      " with. This works because the job of the prefrontal \n",
      " cortex is to narrow down the possible thoughts and \n",
      " behaviors that are suitable in any given situation. This \n",
      " is a crucial mental shortcut because it vastly reduces \n",
      " the time we need to make decisions about what \n",
      " to do or say next. The downside—at least for \n",
      " our creative juices—is that it also reduces the scope \n",
      " of our ideas, making blue sky thinking that much \n",
      " more difficult.  So ideally, the right zone to \n",
      " come up with new ideas is one in which \n",
      " activity in the prefrontal cortex is dialled down a \n",
      " little—a state known as transient hypofrontality. “It’s about using \n",
      " the right tool for the right task. If you \n",
      " want to look for ideas then hypofrontal zoning out \n",
      " will help you,” Chrysikou says. There is more than \n",
      " one way to reduce activity in the prefrontal cortex. \n",
      " Tiredness works particularly well, so working when you are \n",
      " naturally at your least alert (morning for night owls, \n",
      " late in the day for morning folk and after \n",
      " lunch for just about everybody) is definitely worth a \n",
      " try. A boozy drink does something similar, according to \n",
      " actual studies on drunk students. And if all else \n",
      " fails, sitting in a quiet and/or dark room can’t \n",
      " help but set the mind wandering to who knows \n",
      " where. However you manage it, it’s worth remembering that \n",
      " while mindfulness is all the rage at the moment, \n",
      " when you want to think creatively, mindlessness is a \n",
      " much better tool for the job. Go on, zone \n",
      " out—your brain will thank you. But remember to come \n",
      " back into the room at some point to make \n",
      " sure that your ideas aren't too bonkers. \"\"To decide \n",
      " which idea works best, prefrontal involvement is necessary,\"\" Chrysikou \n",
      " says.  The Cramming ZoneThere’s nothing like a deadline \n",
      " to focus the mind. It’s almost what the fight/flight \n",
      " response was designed for: A short burst of adrenaline \n",
      " narrows focus to help you ignore everything except the \n",
      " life-and-death task at hand. The trouble is, if a \n",
      " period of stress goes on too long, or happens \n",
      " too often, the whole system breaks down, focus scatters, \n",
      " and takes your ability to concentrate with it.  \n",
      " This is partly because high doses of stress hormones, \n",
      " particularly noradrenaline, interferes with focus by binding to sites \n",
      " in the prefrontal cortex, stopping it from working effectively. \n",
      " Another job of the prefrontal cortex is to help \n",
      " us resist impulses that aren’t necessarily helpful for our long-term goals, which explains why stress can leave you mainlining down tea and biscuits when you should be doing some work.  So, what to do when you are stressed and distracted but need to focus  now? One option is—strangely—to make whatever you are doing more difficult to concentrate on. According to load theory, the brainchild of psychologist Nilli Lavie at University College London, the brain only has a limited amount of processing power to use on making sense of the world around us. Her experiments have shown that if you add deliberate distractions to what you are trying to concentrate on (flashing images, colorful borders, background noise) it can actually help you focus. This is because processing these distractions uses up the brain’s processing power, leaving no room to process either external distractions—or your own internal excuses.

      " Jeff Stein,Nancy Pelosi says a Clinton landslide could put \n",
      " the House in play. The math backs her up.,\"Nancy \n",
      " Pelosi is getting visions of reclaiming her House gavel. \n",
      " In an interview published by Politico on Thursday, the \n",
      " House minority leader said she is becoming increasingly optimistic \n",
      " that the Democratic Party might take back the House \n",
      " of Representatives in November. They’ll need to flip 30 \n",
      " seats controlled by the Republicans to do so. “I \n",
      " thought in December I would’ve told you we’d win \n",
      " 20 seats, left to our own devices,” Pelosi said \n",
      " in an interview with Politico’s Jake Sherman and Anna \n",
      " Palmer. “(But) seeing the behavior of the [GOP] presidential \n",
      " candidates right after that when the debates [happened], I \n",
      " became even more optimistic because they were so pathetic. \n",
      " … Since then, I think anything is possible.” Most \n",
      " observers think Democrats are unlikely to flip the House. \n",
      " But Pelosi suggested a Hillary Clinton landslide might carry \n",
      " House Democrats to power with her. “If Hillary were \n",
      " to win 54-46, oh my God. It’s all over. \n",
      " If it's 53-47, and I think that’s in the \n",
      " realm of possibility ... that’s a big deal,” Pelosi \n",
      " told Politico. “Five or more [percentage points] is a \n",
      " big deal.” Pelosi’s projections might sound optimistic, but they’re \n",
      " not that far outside the mainstream. Last month, I \n",
      " spoke to Geoffrey Skelley, a political analyst at the \n",
      " University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, who offered a \n",
      " similar theory. Clinton’s lead over Donald Trump has narrowed \n",
      " from late August from 8 points to around 3 \n",
      " points, so a 5-point win seems increasingly unlikely. But \n",
      " if Clinton can somehow reopen her big lead, the \n",
      " House really might be on the table. Here’s why. \n",
      " Get a district to vote for your party’s presidential \n",
      " nominee and your party will also probably win its \n",
      " House seat. That’s not an ironclad rule, but it’s \n",
      " a pretty good indicator — in 2012, only 6 \n",
      " percent of districts that voted for Barack Obama voted \n",
      " a Republican into the House. This is the key \n",
      " to understanding why Skelley thinks a 6-point Clinton win \n",
      " could put the House in play. That kind of \n",
      " national victory would likely mean 50 House districts currently \n",
      " controlled by Republicans would vote for Clinton — therefore \n",
      " suggesting they have a good shot of also going \n",
      " blue at the House level. Of course, a Clinton \n",
      " win in these 50 districts wouldn’t guarantee House Democrats \n",
      " will pick up all of those seats. (Many are \n",
      " held by powerful or longstanding Republican incumbents who are \n",
      " well-funded and enjoy good reputations at home.) But it \n",
      " does mean that Democrats could lose 40 percent of \n",
      " the House races in districts won by Clinton and \n",
      " still take back control of the House. Right now \n",
      " Clinton isn’t projected to win by nearly that much. \n",
      " Averages of all the major polling firms compiled by \n",
      " both RealClearPolitics and the Huffington Post currently put Her \n",
      " lead right around the 3-point mark; she’d need that \n",
      " to come up to where it was after the \n",
      " Democratic convention, which is unlikely but not impossible. \"\"A \n",
      " 6-point lead would help create the conditions for Clinton \n",
      " to pull the Democrats over the finish line to \n",
      " take the House,\"\" Skelley says. \"\"It doesn’t mean they \n",
      " would, of course, but it begins looking really possible.\"\" \n",
      " How does Skelley figure that a 6-point Clinton win \n",
      " would have Democrats winning 50 GOP-controlled House districts? His \n",
      " model begins by assuming that the distribution of the \n",
      " national popular vote margin to the congressional districts will \n",
      " be exactly the same in 2016 as it was \n",
      " in 2012. This may be best illustrated by an \n",
      " example: In 2012, Obama won the popular vote total \n",
      " by 4 percentage points. In Skelley’s model, a 4-point \n",
      " Clinton win would mean she’d also win and lose \n",
      " every congressional district by the exact same amount Obama \n",
      " did. (Of course, this is bound to be wrong \n",
      " in some places — the distribution of Clinton’s vote \n",
      " share certainly won’t be an exact replica of Obama’s. \n",
      " But since there’s no way of knowing exactly how \n",
      " the popular vote will vary by House district from \n",
      " 2012, it’s a useful gauge of what might happen.) \n",
      " This is why a 4-point Clinton win probably wouldn’t \n",
      " flip the House. Obama’s 4-point win over Romney gave \n",
      " him victories in just 28 congressional seats currently controlled \n",
      " by Republicans. That wouldn’t be enough — remember, Democrats \n",
      " need a full 30 to take back the House. \n",
      " But what happens if Clinton expands on Obama’s national \n",
      " vote margin? Since Skelley’s model assumes the national vote \n",
      " share will be evenly distributed, every additional point in \n",
      " the national vote total translates into an additional point \n",
      " for each congressional district. House seats where Democrats tied \n",
      " or lost in 2012 become places where they win \n",
      " at the presidential level in 2016. If Clinton wins \n",
      " by 5 points, according to Skelley, she’d be projected \n",
      " to win in 39 House seats now run by \n",
      " Republicans. That would theoretically put the House in play \n",
      " but would give Democrats very little margin for error. \n",
      " But if she wins by a full 6 points, \n",
      " then 50 seats slide over to the Democratic column \n",
      " — at least at the presidential level, and maybe \n",
      " for the House as well. Now, Skelley isn’t the \n",
      " only close election watcher who is suggesting the House \n",
      " really might be in play. Princeton professor and election \n",
      " guru Sam Wang tried to take another stab at \n",
      " this question by looking at the margin by which \n",
      " Democrats would need to win the popular vote to \n",
      " win the House and then trying to figure out \n",
      " where the popular vote currently appears to be headed. \n",
      " What he found should encourage Democrats. With the exception \n",
      " of just two elections, he found that Democrats have \n",
      " always won back the House when they’ve won the \n",
      " \"\"two-party vote\"\" (voting that excludes third parties): Data from \n",
      " mid-August suggested that they’re on track to do just \n",
      " that. Wang looked at results from something called the \n",
      " \"\"generic ballot\"\" — it asks voters to pick between \n",
      " the two parties, regardless of candidates — as well \n",
      " as the national presidential polling. \"\"If the election were \n",
      " held today, House Democratic candidates would win the popular \n",
      " vote by 5 to 8 percent,\"\" Wang said. \"\"Judging \n",
      " from the last few cycles, that level of public \n",
      " opinion appears to be right on the edge of \n",
      " being enough to give Democrats control of the House.\"\" \n",
      " Still, many of the current projections don’t have the \n",
      " Democrats riding a massive blue wave. The widely respected \n",
      " Cook Political Report, for instance, thinks the party is \n",
      " only on track to nab an additional 16 seats. \n",
      " The Cook Political Report thinks only 33 seats are \n",
      " vulnerable at all, meaning Democrats would have to win \n",
      " 90 percent of all of the competitive races to \n",
      " pull this off. In late August, Emory professor Alan \n",
      " Abramowitz released a model for predicting House races based \n",
      " on the \"\"fundamentals\"\" of the race, including the popularity \n",
      " of the two parties and the number of seats \n",
      " at stake. He found that Democrats only have a \n",
      " 15 percent chance of taking back the House. Similarly, \n",
      " the New York Times’s Nate Cohn argues that there \n",
      " just don’t seem to be enough gettable seats for \n",
      " Democrats. He notes that Democrats’ ability to win back \n",
      " the House in 2006 was made possible by the \n",
      " fact that 21 Republican seats were held in Democratic-leaning \n",
      " districts during that election. There are just nine such \n",
      " seats this year. \"\"If Democrats are going to retake \n",
      " the House anytime soon, November would probably be their \n",
      " best shot,\"\" Cohn said in a story last week, \n",
      " \"\"and as of now it’s not happening.\"\" There’s an \n",
      " elephant-size question hanging over all the analyses of whether \n",
      " a Trump implosion could give Democrats the House: What \n",
      " happens to \"\"ticket splitting?\"\" Ticket splitting refers to the \n",
      " voters who back different parties for Congress and the \n",
      " presidency in the same trip to the polls. In \n",
      " 2012, only a record-low 8 percent of voters did \n",
      " so. If that number goes up in 2016 amid \n",
      " a Clinton landslide, it could give congressional Republicans a \n",
      " buffer from a Trump catastrophe. (Current polling suggests Republican \n",
      " congressional candidates are much more popular than Trump, but \n",
      " it’s unclear how many of the party’s typical voters \n",
      " will actually show up on Election Day.) This is \n",
      " why the X-factor of Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson makes \n",
      " these kinds of projections much more difficult. Clinton’s lead \n",
      " over Trump in most polls puts her about 6 \n",
      " points ahead, but that’s in part because of how \n",
      " weak Trump is — she’s normally polling around the \n",
      " 47 or 48 percent mark, and he’s closer to \n",
      " 41 or 42 percent. If Johnson gets in the \n",
      " neighborhood of 5 percent of the national vote, do \n",
      " his supporters vote for congressional Democrats? Or will they \n",
      " vote Republican down ballot — and make Clinton's big \n",
      " national lead less crucial? This is why Skelley thinks \n",
      " Clinton herself probably needs to win more than 50 \n",
      " percent of the vote to pull Democrats over the \n",
      " finish line. If, for instance, she’s just beating Trump \n",
      " by 48 to 42, then congressional Democrats might need \n",
      " Johnson voters to go blue down ballot, which seems \n",
      " unlikely. \"\"If she’s only winning barely over 50 percent \n",
      " of the vote, I think it’s difficult to say \n",
      " with confidence that she’ll pull a lot of Democrats \n",
      " with her,\"\" Skelley said. \"\"I think she needs to \n",
      " really win the popular vote by more than that.\"\" \n",
      " It’s a colossal understatement to say that the stakes \n",
      " are pretty darn high when it comes to control \n",
      " of the House. If Democrats also go on to \n",
      " win the Senate, winning the House would open the \n",
      " doors for a raft of legislative priorities over climate \n",
      " change, immigration, and a range of other long-held blue \n",
      " sky policy goals for the party. So far, most \n",
      " chatter around a Clinton presidency involves big plans like \n",
      " infrastructure reform and new Supreme Court appointments. Sweeping Congress \n",
      " and the presidency would transform those ambitions into a \n",
      " wholly different kind. But there’s another, and perhaps equally \n",
      " important, reason this fight is so crucial: It may \n",
      " be Democrats’ last shot at the House for a very, very long time. New York magazine’s Ed Kilgore explains: If Democrats do fall short of what they need to regain control of the House even as Hillary Clinton becomes president, prospects for further gains in the near term will probably not be good. The party controlling the White House almost always loses House seats in midterms (1998 and 2002 were the rare exceptions), and 2018 would be a third-term midterm for Democrats, making the odds of an anti–White House trend even stronger. Beyond that, Democrats have a well-known midterm turnout problem associated with their heavy reliance on parts of the electorate — notably young people and minorities — that rarely turn out proportionately in nonpresidential elections. As for 2020, it’s worth noting that Democrats gained only eight House seats when President Obama was reelected in 2012. Many Democrats have certainly come to despise Trump over the course of a bitter and long campaign. But if he can blunder his way into giving them control of the House of Representatives far earlier than anyone thought possible, maybe they can come to forgive him.\",https://www.vox.com/2016/9/8/12847958/house-democrats-clinton,,Vox\n",

      " at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “Every president in \n",
      " modern times has taken the strong medicine of divestiture,” \n",
      " Shaub said. Trump’s plan “does not comport with the \n",
      " traditions of the presidency over the past 40 years.” \n",
      " The president-elect announced Wednesday morning that he would hand \n",
      " management of the Trump Organization over to his adult \n",
      " sons and the company’s chief financial officer. He promised \n",
      " to insulate himself from his businesses by donating the \n",
      " profits from foreign stays at his hotel to the \n",
      " federal government and limiting the information he received about \n",
      " his profits and losses. Shaub called the structure “perplexing.” \n",
      " Trump will still know where his business interests lie. \n",
      " He made clear that he plans to return to \n",
      " his company after his presidency. Ethics experts have long \n",
      " contended that the only real solution is a blind \n",
      " trust: Trump should sell his properties and allow someone \n",
      " else to invest the proceeds from the sale so \n",
      " that he doesn’t know what he owns. Trump’s lawyer \n",
      " said a blind trust would, essentially, be too difficult \n",
      " and expensive, since it would require Trump to sell \n",
      " large amounts of real estate. “The president is now \n",
      " entering a world of public service,” Shaub said. “He’s \n",
      " going to be asking his own appointees to make \n",
      " sacrifices. He’s going to be asking our men and \n",
      " women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts \n",
      " around the world. So no, I don’t think divestiture \n",
      " is too high a price to pay to be \n",
      " president of the United States of America.” The Office \n",
      " of Government Ethics has hammered out hundreds, if not \n",
      " thousands, of divestiture agreements involving federal officials. They have \n",
      " had to “divest assets, break open trusts, and dissolve \n",
      " businesses,” Shaub said, and taking those steps can be \n",
      " expensive and painful. But, Shaub said, “their basic patriotism \n",
      " usually prevails as they agree to set aside their \n",
      " personal interests to serve their country’s interests.” When officials \n",
      " were reluctant to take the required steps, the ethics \n",
      " office’s demands were backed up by “the unwavering example \n",
      " of presidents who resolved their own conflicts of interest.” \n",
      " Presidents in the past didn’t just set an example \n",
      " for the rest of their administration, Shaub said. They \n",
      " helped the American system of government set an example \n",
      " for the world on avoiding corruption. The Office of \n",
      " Government Ethics is charged with ensuring there are no \n",
      " conflicts of interest. Its employees search through thousands of \n",
      " pages of financial disclosures and reach agreements with would-be \n",
      " Cabinet nominees, as well as lower-level officials, stating the \n",
      " steps they’ll take to make sure their private investments \n",
      " and public duties don’t conflict. It’s a relatively obscure, \n",
      " generally apolitical agency, and Shaub — who was a \n",
      " career public servant in the office before being appointed \n",
      " by President Obama in 2013 to his first five-year \n",
      " term as director — is far from a public \n",
      " figure. His decision to make a public speech criticizing \n",
      " the incoming president-elect was highly unusual. But emails between \n",
      " the Trump transition team and the ethics office showed \n",
      " that Trump has had little regard for the office’s \n",
      " work since he came into office. For 10 days \n",
      " after the election, offers of assistance and guidance on \n",
      " ensuring an ethical transition were rebuffed. Nor did Trump’s \n",
      " lawyers run their plans past Shaub. If they had, \n",
      " he said, he would have told them it was \n",
      " very possible for the president to sell his real \n",

      " have done so. As for Trump’s other justification — \n",
      " that the president “can’t have a conflict of interest” \n",
      " — that’s nonsense, Shaub said. “A conflict of interest is anything that creates an incentive to put your own interest before the interests of the people you serve,” Shaub said, quoting a Supreme Court decision from 1961 that called conflicts of interest “an evil which endangers the very fabric of democratic society.” If anything, Shaub said, it’s more important for presidents to avoid conflicts of interest: “The potential for corruption only grows with the increase in power.”\",https://www.vox.com/2017/1/11/14243146/trump-conflicts-office-government-ethics-speech,,Vox\n",

      " story published Friday, the Times reported that Facebook is \n",
      " planning to combine the technology for all three of \n",
      " its standalone messaging apps: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. That \n",
      " would enable an Instagram user, for example, to send \n",
      " and receive messages to people using WhatsApp, something that \n",
      " isn’t currently possible. Setting aside the technical challenges of \n",
      " connecting different apps with different features — WhatsApp only \n",
      " requires your phone number, for example, while Instagram allows \n",
      " you to have an anonymous account — the move \n",
      " would create one giant Facebook messaging ecosystem. Each of \n",
      " those services has more than a billion users. There \n",
      " are a lot of people who already think Facebook \n",
      " is a monopoly. This move won’t change their opinion. \n",
      " “This is why there should have been far more \n",
      " scrutiny during Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp which \n",
      " now clearly seem like horizontal mergers that should have \n",
      " triggered antitrust scrutiny,” tweeted Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democratic \n",
      " congressman from California. “Imagine how different the world would \n",
      " be if Facebook had to compete with Instagram and \n",
      " WhatsApp. That would have encouraged real competition that would \n",
      " have promoted privacy and benefited consumers.” Could the FTC \n",
      " try and break up Facebook? It certainly feels possible. \n",
      " But as The Verge’s Casey Newton pointed out Friday \n",
      " in his daily newsletter, Facebook may beat them to the punch. “If the Federal Trade Commission ever planned to compel Facebook to spin out WhatsApp and Instagram — a big if, I know — you can imagine the company explaining that there was no longer such a thing as ‘WhatsApp’ or ‘Instagram,’” Newton wrote. Maybe something for Zuckerberg to explain in his next op-ed.
